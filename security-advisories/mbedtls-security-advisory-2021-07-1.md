## Vulnerability

The modular exponentiation operation in RSA uses a sliding window algorithm,
with a memory access pattern that depends on the bits of the secret key.

Exponent blinding is used as a counter-measure: it prevents an attacker from
correlating informations gathered on successive operation, but researchers
found a way to recover enough information by observing a single operation,
therefore by-passing this counter-measure.

## Impact

An attacker with access to precise enough timing and memory access information
(typically an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave such as
SGX or the TrustZone secure world) can recover the private keys used in RSA.

## Resolution

Affected users will want to upgrade to Mbed TLS 3.0.0, 2.27.0 or 2.16.11
depending on the branch they're currently using.

## Work-around

None.
