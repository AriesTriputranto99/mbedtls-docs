# PolarSSL Security Advisory 2014-02

**Title** |  Denial of Service against GCM enabled servers (and clients)
---|---
**CVE** |  CVE-2014-4911
**Date** |  11th of July 2014
**Affects** |  All PolarSSL versions before 1.2.11 and 1.3.8
**Not affected** |  All branches before 1.2.x and version > 1.2.10 or > 1.3.7
**Impact** |  Crash of server application (or clients by a malicious server)
**Exploit** |  Withheld

A denial of service against PolarSSL servers that offer GCM ciphersuites has
been found using the fuzzing techniques of the Codenomicon Defensics toolkit.
Potentially clients are affected too if a malicious server decides to execute
the denial of service attack against its clients.

## Impact

A server or client that is targeted with this attack can be potentially
crashed with a segfault.

## Workaround

Disabling of the GCM ciphersuites prevents this attack.

Alternatively the following patch can be applied to your current PolarSSL
1.3.7 code base:

## Resolution

Upgrade to PolarSSL 1.3.8 for the 1.3 branch or PolarSSL 1.2.11 for the 1.2
branch.
